[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/HeraKumi/hoshiMenu.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/HeraKumi/hoshiMenu)

# requirements

- Make
- cmake >= 3.9
- ncurses >= 6.1
- curlpp >= 0.8.1

# Build

`sh setup/setup.sh`

# Why?

Well because I am learning to use cmake with c++ wait let me reword that, I am currently learning cmake and c++.

But for this little simple(maybe) project, I wanted to make a package updater, bloat cleaner for other distro's I use. Becuase well I am lazy always typing `sudo pacman -Syu` to update my whole system.

# TODO

- [ ] rebuild without `ncurses`
