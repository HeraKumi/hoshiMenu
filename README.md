# Why?
Well because I am learning to use cmake with c++ wait let me reword that, I am currently learning cmake and c++.

But for this little simple(maybe) project, I wanted to make a package updater, bloat cleaner for other distro's I use. Becuase well I am lazy always typing `sudo pacman -Syu` to update my whole system lol.
